# Eiffel Base Extension #2
## Inspired from Python
There are a number of functions for STRING and ARRAY classes that are missing from the standard Base library. These features are quite useful. One of the most useful is the capacity to output the array as a well-formed JSON string. The others related to making various forms of repeating strings. There are perhaps others.

This library is here as a place to design and build such features found in languages like Python, but not yet found in the Eiffel standard libraries.
